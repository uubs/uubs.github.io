It's easy to make words **bold** and other words *italic* with markdown. You can even[Link to Google](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* start a line with a star
* profit

Alternatively,

- Dash work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before th dash or star:
  - like this
  - and this

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > charter before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it
>
> \- Captain Janeway

for inline code blocks, wrap them in backicks: `var example = true`. you can indent with four spaces:

```c
if (isAwesom) {
    
}
```
